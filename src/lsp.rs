//! ## Language server protocol
//!
//! Specification can be found at
//! <https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/>.
//!
//! We're not interested in supporting or even parsing the whole protocol, we only want a subset
//! that will allow us to mupltiplex messages between multiple clients and a single server.
//!
//! LSP has several main message types:
//!
//! ### Request Message
//! Requests from client to server. Requests contain an `id` property which is either `integer` or
//! `string`.
//!
//! ### Response Message
//! Responses from server for client requests. Also contain an `id` property, but according to the
//! the specification it can also be null, it's unclear what we should do when it is null. We could
//! either send the response to all clients or drop it.
//!
//! ### Notification Message
//! Notifications must not receive a response, this doesn't really mean anything to us as we're
//! just relaying the messages. It sounds like it'd allow us to simply pass a notification from any
//! client to the server and to pass a server notification to all clients, however there are some
//! subtypes of notifications defined by the LSP where that could be confusing to the client or
//! server:
//! - Cancel notifications - contains an `id` property again, so we could multiplex this like any
//!   other request
//! - Progress notifications - contains a `token` property which could be used to identify the
//!   client but the specification also says it has nothing to do with the request IDs
